# SQL_New_landing_page_test
In this project we compare the bounce rate of the old landing page "/home" and the new landing page "/lander-1" to find out which one is better. From the results of the analysis we know that the new landing page "/lander-1" has a lower bounce rate than the old landing page "/home". Thus we can replace the landing page with a new one because it is considered to attract more users to stay on our website (low bounced rates). I limit analysis in to the time before "2012-07-28" with utm_source = "gsearch" and utm_campaign = "nonbrand".
